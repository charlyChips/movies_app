## Enhacements
 
 This project is just a demo of my Flutter skills, and it have some enhacements for To Do in the future (pending enhacements because of missing time with my actual tasks). Some of them are in the following points:
 
 * Dio Facade ( A layer for decouple networking )
 * Test coverage
 * Error handling (the block of code to catch the errors are empty, that is why when an error happened just throw an UnimplementedError instead of create the own project errors)

## Conclusions
